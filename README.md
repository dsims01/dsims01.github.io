Derek Sims
Assignment 1

All aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. I have a functional
website with an index.html, resume.html, and bio.html

I collaborated with my roommate Frances Hughes, who helped me figure out how
to correctly reference pictures in html.

I spent around three hours on this assignment.
